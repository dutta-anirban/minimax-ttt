# Tic-Tac-Toe with a Minimax AI

## Players
There's a switch on the interface to indicate if one would like to play with another human or a computer player.
The computer player uses the [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to approach the human player.

## Elements
* [tkinter â€” Python interface to Tcl/Tk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
* [Minimax Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

## Gitpod Support
On the Gitpod executable environment's terminal, run ```python minimax-ttt.py``` to execute the game.
NOTE: Make sure ```python 3.x``` is set up beforehand. Likewise, having the Python extension installed works.
